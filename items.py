lore={
    #holsters
    "holster1":"Passed down from dusty drifters and battle-hardened gunslingers, the Worn Leather Holster has felt the heat of countless duels. Its faded stitches and scuffed leather tell tales of narrow escapes, lost loves, and showdowns under burning skies. It may be simple, but it carries the spirit of every hand that’s ever gripped it."
    ,"holster2":"Crafted for showdowns at high noon, the Silver Spur Holster isn’t just for carrying a gun—it’s a symbol of prestige. Its polished leather gleams under the sun, blinding rivals just long enough to give its owner the edge. Rumored to have been owned by an infamous outlaw-turned-hero, its silver accents shimmer like the line between fame and infamy."
    ,"holster3":"Forged from the hide of a legendary desert serpent, the Rattlesnake Coil is said to carry the snake’s venomous spirit. Quick-draw legends claim it hisses softly when danger’s near, its slick surface perfect for lightning-fast reflexes. Some say if you listen closely, you can hear the faint rattle of its namesake, warning foes of their impending doom."

    #guns
    ,"gun1":"Simple, rugged, and reliable, Rust Fang has seen more dust than daylight. Its chipped barrel and worn grip tell tales of countless skirmishes, yet it bites just as hard as any fancy firearm—perfect for those who value grit over glory."
    ,"gun2":"Forged from the remnants of an outlaw’s cursed spurs, this gun carries the echoes of every duel it’s claimed. Its barrel hums faintly, like distant hoofbeats chasing down the souls of those too slow to draw."
    ,"gun3":"Once the prized possession of a legendary sharpshooter whose aim never faltered, this relic’s grip still feels warm, as if fueled by the lingering spirit of its former master. It never misses—unless fate itself intervenes."
    ,"gun4":"Drenched in the blood-red hue of vengeance, this revolver was born from betrayal and fired in fury. Every shot whispers the names of the fallen, hungry for one more soul to balance the scales."
    ,"gun5":"This isn’t just a gun—it’s a legend reborn. Crafted from the wreckage of war machines and tempered in relentless battles, the Steel Revenant is said to return to its owner, no matter how far it’s lost, as if bound by an unbreakable oath."

    #boots
    ,"boot1":"Passed down from drifter to drifter, these boots have felt the grit of desert sands, the chill of mountain passes, and the creak of saloon floors. Every scratch and scuff tells a tale of dusty roads, narrow escapes, and standoffs under the burning sun."
    ,"boot2":"Said to have belonged to a notorious outlaw with a knack for charm and chaos, these pink beauties carry the echoes of mischief and moonlit getaways. Perfect for those who’d rather leave a trail of stardust than footprints in the dirt."
    ,"boot3":"Forged in the heart of a relentless desert, these boots carry the legacy of a man who walked through scorching sands and raging wildfires, defying both nature and fate. Betrayed and left for dead, he rose from the ashes, his footsteps burning with fury and purpose. The very sun seemed to brand its mark into the leather, leaving behind a trace of its unyielding blaze. To wear these boots is to carry the fire of a spirit that refused to be extinguished."
    
    #hats
    ,"hat1":"This hat isn’t just for show—it’s for those who ride where the road takes them, never looking back. Some say it once belonged to a lone rider who swore an unbreakable oath, though whether it was to protect, avenge, or simply survive is a tale lost to time. Those who wear it carry the weight of past journeys and the promise of roads yet to be ridden."
    ,"hat2":"Once worn by a fearless sheriff who brought law to the lawless, this hat is a symbol of justice, grit, and unwavering resolve. The stars stitched into the band represent the deputies who stood beside him—some rode into legend, others fell in the line of duty. Whether worn by a true lawman or a rogue enforcer, it commands respect in any saloon."

    #jackets
    ,"jacket1":"Crafted from rugged leather and stained with the sands of the frontier, this jacket has seen more than its fair share of the wild. It was worn by Dustrunner, a legendary scout who could outrun any storm and outlast any trail. They say the jacket carries the whispers of the desert wind, offering its wearer both protection and speed."
    ,"jacket2":"This sleek, black jacket belonged to a mysterious figure known as the Nightstalker, who moved like a shadow through the darkest corners of the frontier. No one saw him coming, but everyone heard the echo of his last step. The jacket is said to grant its wearer the ability to disappear in the night, blending into the darkness while keeping watch on those who lurk."
